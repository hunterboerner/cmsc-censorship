\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we have seen different file-sharing protocols and methods of
censoring them. While the censorship methods are not unique to file sharing we
have shown that there are a wide variety of methods to thwart filesharing
programs. We have also discussed censorship methods in practice in both Iran and
China. Future work could explore filesharing specific methods of censorship
which as of writing does not appear to have been done.
