\subsection{Legally Hardened System}

There is a paper that described a \textsc{p2p} system which doesn't require a
file to be stored (even encrypted) on a
node.\cite{CensorshipresistantAnonymousP2P} This provides the advantage that if
a censor knows the fingerprint of a file then they will no be able to block the
file on this network as only the receiver is able to identify the file being
transmitted.


In the \textsc{ipfs} there is (or was) a mechanism for censoring content by
messing with the Distributed Hash
Table.\cite{sridharContentCensorshipInterPlanetary2023}

In a study conducted in Singapore, the authors found that users of \textsc{p2p}
file sharing did so for the following reasons:\cite{MoreJustFree}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item Public methods are too slow;
  \item Hard to find or censored content;
  \item Sampling content;
  \item Because it's free.
\end{enumerate}
