\abstract{Filesharing is an integral use of networked computers. As such, there
      have been a multitude of application protocols developed to facilitate the
      exchange of binary information. In this paper we survey the origins of
      filesharing with Usenet and networked protocols, analyze modern attempts at
      creating distributed file systems, and finally, examine efforts to provide
      anonymity when accessing these files. We further consider different protocol
      interference methods, such as IP-level filtering, packet dropping, and domain
      fronting, to examine how various filesharing protocols resist these types of
      censorship attacks. To conduct our examination, we study the real-world
      examples of both Iran, and the Great Firewall of China, and evaluate the
      limitations among these approaches. Our study lays a framework that will
      provide insight into the geopolitical landscape of networked computer access.}
