\abstract{ Filesharing is a core functionality of networked systems. On the
    ethernet or clearnet protocols such as NFS, Samba (SMB), and AFS allow for
    filesharing between multiple clients. For the early internet systmes such as
    Usenet which are centralized became popular for filesharing. Later,
    Bittorrent became a popular method of sharing files because of its
    distributed nature and approach to prioritizing the least available blocks
    first to improve network performance. Since file sharing systems frequently
    are used for illegal or copyrighted content, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
    hosted in countries with lax regulations allow for circumventing DMCA
    takedown requests. Eventually ``shadow libraries'' such as LibGen became
    popular for pirating books and scientific articles. These services provide
    the files over IPFS, a distributed object file system, or over Tor, an onion
    routing anonymization framework.}
