  abstract = {Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) consist of mesh routers and mesh clients, where mesh routers have minimal mobility and form the backbone of WMNs. They provide network access for both mesh and conventional clients. The integration of WMNs with other networks such as the Internet, cellular, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15, IEEE 802.16, sensor networks, etc., can be accomplished through the gateway and bridging functions in the mesh routers. Mesh clients can be either stationary or mobile, and can form a client mesh network among themselves and with mesh routers. WMNs are anticipated to resolve the limitations and to significantly improve the performance of ad hoc networks, wireless local area networks (WLANs), wireless personal area networks (WPANs), and wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs). They are undergoing rapid progress and inspiring numerous deployments. WMNs will deliver wireless services for a large variety of applications in personal, local, campus, and metropolitan areas. Despite recent advances in wireless mesh networking, many research challenges remain in all protocol layers. This paper presents a detailed study on recent advances and open research issues in WMNs. System architectures and applications of WMNs are described, followed by discussing the critical factors influencing protocol design. Theoretical network capacity and the state-of-the-art protocols for WMNs are explored with an objective to point out a number of open research issues. Finally, testbeds, industrial practice, and current standard activities related to WMNs are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Wireless mesh networks are being widely deployed around the world as a mean to provide low-cost access to the Internet. An orthogonal evolution in computer networking has been the rise of peer-to-peer communication. Structured peer-to-peer overlay networks have been used as platform for building large-scale distributed network applications such as file sharing. It is of interest to build those distributed application over wireless mesh networks. Unfortunately, conventional structured P2P overlays are not suitable for direct deployment in a mobile and wireless environment. We argue for a dual-layer mesh network architecture with support from wireless mesh routers for peer-to-peer applications. We demonstrate using extensive simulations that this approach has excellent potential to improve the performance of peer-to-peer applications in a wireless setting; specifically we focus on file sharing but other applications can also be supported by this approach.},

If someone wants to hide his/her identity, the most suitable choice is to use anonymous communication. Anonymous communication not only provides anonymity but also privacy. Anonymity is not something which was invented with the Internet. To overcome this and provide anonymity, anonymous communication systems were developed. In this paper a comparison of The Onion Router and Invisible Internet Project is presented. The Onion Router is the most deployed anonymous communication system that provides online anonymity and privacy while The Invisible Internet Project allows applications to send messages to each other pseudonymously and securely by using garlic routing.},

In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyper links. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.},

These overlays are highly resilient; they can route messages correctly even when a large fraction of the nodes crash or the network partitions. But current overlays are not secure; even a small fraction of malicious nodes can prevent correct message delivery throughout the overlay. This problem is particularly serious in open peer-to-peer systems, where many diverse, autonomous parties without preexisting trust relationships wish to pool their resources. This paper studies attacks aimed at preventing correct message delivery in structured peer-to-peer overlays and presents defenses to these attacks. We describe and evaluate techniques that allow nodes to join the overlay, to maintain routing state, and to forward messages securely in the presence of malicious nodes.},

Owing to this rapid growth, the deployment of IoT-oriented networks based on mesh topologies is very attractive, thanks to their scalability and reliability (in the presence of failures). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the following relevant wireless technologies: IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4-oriented, and Sub-GHz-based LoRa. Our goal is to highlight how various communication technologies may be suitable for mesh networking, either providing a native support or being adapted subsequently. Hence, we discuss how these wireless technologies, being either standard or proprietary, can adapt to IoT scenarios (e.g., smart cities and smart agriculture) in which the heterogeneity of the involved devices is a key feature. Finally, we provide reference use cases involving all the analyzed mesh-oriented technologies.},

If the keyword is present, TCP reset packets (viz: with the RST flag set) are sent to both endpoints of the connection, which then close. However, because the original packets are passed through the firewall unscathed, if the endpoints completely ignore the firewall’s resets, then the connection will proceed unhindered. Once one connection has been blocked, the firewall makes further easy-to-evade attempts to block further connections from the same machine. This latter behaviour can be leveraged into a denial-of-service attack on third-party machines.},

It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself. In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet. Passed on October 12, 1998, by a unanimous vote in the United States Senate and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on October 28, 1998, the DMCA amended Title 17 of the United States Code to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the liability of the providers of online services for copyright infringement by their users. The DMCA's principal innovation in the field of copyright is the exemption from direct and indirect liability of Internet service providers and other intermediaries. This exemption was adopted by the European Union in the Electronic Commerce Directive 2000. The Information Society Directive 2001 implemented the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty in the EU.},

  abstract = {The Tor network relies on individuals to set up relays for it to operate. Campaigns have in the past been successfully made to invite more people to join, and the network currently consists of close to 6,500 relays, spread globally. Although the Latin American region has many characteristics that make it natural to expect a wide participation in Tor, it has lagged behind most of the world in its Tor activity — Both considering client usage and participation as relays. This study focuses on the difficulties the Mexican user community has faced in setting up Tor relays, and presents how –and why– we deployed a relatively very simple and unsophisticated network censorship reporting system, as well as the results we have received so far. While this is still considered a work in progress, it has yielded important results as an aide allowing to specify the needed characteristics for potential relays, with a clear, measurable result.},

  abstract = {HTTPS composes large parts of today's Internet traffic and has long been subject to censorship efforts in different countries. While censors analyze the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to block encrypted HTTP traffic, censorship circumvention efforts have primarily focused on other protocols such as TCP. In this paper, we hypothesize that the TLS protocol offers previously unseen opportunities for censorship circumvention techniques. We tested our hypothesis by proposing possible censorship circumvention techniques that act on the TLS protocol. To validate the effectiveness of these techniques, we evaluate their acceptance by popular TLS servers and successfully demonstrate that these techniques can circumvent censors in China and Iran. In our evaluations, we discovered 38-partially standard-compliant-distinct censorship circumvention techniques, which we could group into 11 unique categories. Additionally, we provide novel insights into how China censors TLS traffic by presenting evidence of at least three distinct censorship appliances. We suspect that other parts of China's censorship apparatus and other censors exhibit similar structures and advocate future censorship research to anticipate them. With this work, we hope to aid people affected by censorship and stimulate further research into censorship circumvention using cryptographic protocols.},

Slight changes are found on the distribution of Dutch peers, but these seem related to the awareness raised by blocking rather than the blocking itself.},

IPFS is used as remote data storage for numerous blockchain-based smart contracts, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), and decentralized applications. We present a content censorship attack that can be executed with minimal effort and cost, and that prevents the retrieval of any chosen content in the IPFS network. The attack exploits a conceptual issue in a core component of IPFS, the Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT), which is used to resolve content IDs to peer addresses. We provide efficient detection and mitigation mechanisms for this vulnerability. Our mechanisms achieve a 99.6\textbackslash\% detection rate and mitigate 100\textbackslash\% of the detected attacks with minimal signaling and computational overhead. We followed responsible disclosure procedures, and our countermeasures are scheduled for deployment in the future versions of IPFS.},

  abstract = {Usenet (), a portmanteau of User's Network, is a worldwide distributed discussion system available on computers. It was developed from the general-purpose Unix-to-Unix Copy (UUCP) dial-up network architecture. Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis conceived the idea in 1979, and it was established in 1980. Users read and post messages (called articles or posts, and collectively termed news) to one or more topic categories, known as newsgroups. Usenet resembles a bulletin board system (BBS) in many respects and is the precursor to the Internet forums that have become widely used. Discussions are threaded, as with web forums and BBSes, though posts are stored on the server sequentially. A major difference between a BBS or web message board and Usenet is the absence of a central server and dedicated administrator or hosting provider. Usenet is distributed among a large, constantly changing set of news servers that store and forward messages to one another via "news feeds". Individual users may read messages from and post to a local (or simply preferred) news server, which can be operated by anyone, and those posts will automatically be forwarded to any other news servers peered with the local one, while the local server will receive any news its peers have that it currently lacks. This results in the automatic proliferation of content posted by any user on any server to any other user subscribed to the same newsgroups on other servers. As with BBSes and message boards, individual news servers or service providers are under no obligation to carry any specific content, and may refuse to do so for many reasons: a news server might attempt to control the spread of spam by refusing to accept or forward any posts that trigger spam filters, or a server without high-capacity data storage may refuse to carry any newsgroups used primarily for file sharing, limiting itself to discussion-oriented groups. However, unlike BBSes and web forums, the dispersed nature of Usenet usually permits users who are interested in receiving some content to access it simply by choosing to connect to news servers that carry the feeds they want. Usenet is culturally and historically significant in the networked world, having given rise to, or popularized, many widely recognized concepts and terms such as "FAQ", "flame", "sockpuppet", and "spam".  In the early 1990s, shortly before access to the Internet became commonly affordable, Usenet connections via FidoNet's dial-up BBS networks made long-distance or worldwide discussions and other communication widespread, not needing a server, just (local) telephone service. The name Usenet comes from the term "users' network". The first Usenet group was NET.general, which quickly became net.general. The first commercial spam on Usenet was from immigration attorneys Canter and Siegel advertising green card services. On the Internet, Usenet is transported via the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 119 for standard, unprotected connections, and on TCP port 563 for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypted connections.},

During the last decade, techniques for conducting Internet censorship have been developed further. Consequently, methodology for measuring Internet censorship had been improved as well. In this paper, we firstly provide a survey of Internet censorship techniques. Secondly, we survey censorship measurement methodology, including a coverage of available datasets. In cases where it is beneficial, we bridge the terminology and taxonomy of Internet censorship with related domains, namely traffic obfuscation and information hiding. We cover both, technical and human aspects, as well as recent trends, and challenges.},

  abstract = {Since its inception, BitTorrent has proved to be the most popular approach for sharing large files using the peer-to-peer paradigm. BitTorrent introduced several innovative mechanisms such as tit-for-tat (TFT) and rarest first to enable efficient distribution of files among the participating peers. Several studies examining the performance of BitTorrent and its mechanisms have been published in the literature. In this paper, we present a survey of performance studies of BitTorrent from 2003 to 2008. We categorize these studies based on the techniques used, the mechanisms studied and the resulting observations about BitTorrent performance. Many of the performance studies also suggested modifications to BitTorrent's mechanisms to further improve its performance. We also present a survey of the suggested improvements and categorize them into different groups.},

  abstract = {Wireless mesh networks have attracted considerable interest in recent years in both the academic and industrial communities. As wireless mesh routers can be interconnected through wireless links, wireless mesh networks provide greater flexibility and better cost-effectiveness. In particular, due to their ease of installation and maintenance, they can be used in different environments, especially where cable installation is difficult. Apart from providing routing service, wireless mesh networks can also be employed to provide other value-added services. Inspired by cloud computing and other distributed file systems, this paper presents the design and implementation of MeshFS, a distributed file system specifically for wireless mesh networks. A key technical challenge is to develop a lightweight software system that can be implemented over memory-limited wireless mesh network environments. With the aim of providing a lightweight distributed file system, allowing limited resources to be utilized more effectively, MeshFS integrates scattered storage resources from wireless mesh routers to provide a mountable file system interface to Unix/Linux file system with fault-tolerant capabilities and cloud computing-like storage functions.},
